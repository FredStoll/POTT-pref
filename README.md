# POTT-pref
Analyses of the POTT dataset, with a focus on preference representation

This dataset contains the activity of >7,000 single neurons recorded across ventral frontal cortex and amygdala while animals performed a two-choice probabilistic task.
Neuronal activity is analysed using both encoding and decoding techniques, at the level of single neurons and populations. 

The scripts here allow the reproduction of the analyses described in Stoll & Rudebeck, bioRxiv, 2023 ( https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.10.540239v1 ).
